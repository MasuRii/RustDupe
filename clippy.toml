# RustDupe - Clippy configuration
#
# This file configures Clippy thresholds and project-wide lint settings.
# Lint levels are configured in src/lib.rs using #![warn(...)] and #![allow(...)] attributes.
#
# Run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
# Run with all lints: cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic -D warnings

# Maximum number of function arguments before too_many_arguments triggers
too-many-arguments-threshold = 7

# Maximum number of lines in a function before too_many_lines triggers
too-many-lines-threshold = 150

# Maximum cognitive complexity before cognitive_complexity triggers
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 25

# Maximum number of struct fields before too-many-fields triggers
# (Not used by default, but good to document)
type-complexity-threshold = 250

# MSRV for clippy to check against
# This should match rust-version in Cargo.toml
msrv = "1.85.0"
